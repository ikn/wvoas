"""A simple, exact, 2D collision handler.

'Simple' means objects are rigid and consist of axis-aligned lines, which means
no rotation or deformation.

'Exact' means collisions are not estimated, but computed exactly, which means
bullets don't go through walls, and jumping characters land on the ground
instead of hovering just above it.

Note on directions: where taken as an argument or used in a data structure, a
direction is an integer from 0 to 3, which correspond to left to bottom,
clockwise.

elast: the elasticity of collisions with this object.  When a collision occurs,
       the product of the elasticities of the colliding objects is the ratio of
       the speed in the collision direction retained afterwards.  The value
       should be between 0 (no bounce) and 1 (no speed loss).  Values > 1
       (speed increase) are supported, but can easily lead to very large
       speeds, so watch out for position and velocity values of inf or nan.
frict: the friction of collisions with this object.  The product of frictions
       of the colliding objects gives the maximum reduction in speed difference
       perpendicular to the collision direction.  Should be 0 (no effect) or
       above.
layer: the object's collision layer(s).  This is an integer; objects o1 and o2

objs: list of (Static)Object instances for this CollisionHandler to handle.
before_cb: a function to call when two objects collide, before the collision
           has been processed.  Arguments given are
           (o1, o2, dirn, i1, i2, data), where:
    o1, o2: the colliding objects.
    dirn: the direction of the line on o1 that collides (that of o2 is the
          opposite).
    i1, i2: the respective indices of the colliding line in each object's shape
            - that is, the line for o1 is o1.shape.lines[i][i1], and similar
            for o2.
    data: a two-element list, [elast, frict], where these are the combined
          elasticity and friction that will be used for the collision.  You can
          modify the elements of this list to change the values that will be
          used.
           The callback can return True to skip handling this collision (the
           objects will pass through each other).
after_cb: a function to call when two objects collide, after the collision has
          been processed.  Arguments given are (o1, o2, dirn, i1, i2, impulse),
          where most are as for before_cb, and impulse is the magnitude of the
          impulse (change in momentum) generated by the collision (taking the
          effect of friction into account).
touching_cb: a function to call whenever two objects are touching after all
             collisions have been handled.  This may be called in the same
             call to update as col_cb for the same objects, if they are still
             touching, but may not if they move apart before the end of the
             update.  Arguments are (o1, o2, dirn, i1, i2) as passed to col_cb.
err: the maximum distance objects can be from each other and still be
     considered to be touching.  This only matters if their combined elasticity
     is non-zero (otherwise, it is easy to be at 0 distance).  Regardless of
     this value, objects only start touching if they collide at some point.
