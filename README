World View of a Slime (release 2-dev): a 2D puzzle platformer where only a
small part of the world exists at a time.

This was originally made for a 48-hour competition in June 2012, with the theme
'tiny screen size'; this version is the result of further development.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

This should work wherever Pygame does.  On systems with a sh-compatible shell,
do

    ./run

On other systems (Windows, for example), run game.py with your Python 2
executable.

    PLAYING

The aim is to reach the flag in each level.  Falling off the bottom of the
screen or squashing the slime results in dying.  Blue squares are checkpoints;
the last one you touched turns green.

    CONTROLS

arrow keys, WASD: move, jump.
space: jump.
escape, backspace: pause.
escape, backspace, space, enter: unpause.
mouse movement: move the visible window.
R: reset the level.
+, -: increase/decrease volume.

Levels can be skipped from the pause screen by pressing the highlighted letter.
Once the game has been finished, you can return to the level select screen in
the same way.

WASD to move and R to reset are in the same position for the AZERTY (ZQSD R)
and Dvorak (,AOE P) keyboard layouts too.

To quit, close the window.

    FILES

This game saves settings in ~/.config/wvoas/config on Unix-like OSs, and in
%APPDATA\wvoas\conf on Windows.
