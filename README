World View of a Slime is a 2D puzzle platformer where only a small part of the
world exists at a time.

This was made for a 48-hour competition in June 2012, with the theme 'tiny
screen size'.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

./configure
./run

Should work wherever Pygame does.

    PLAYING

The aim is to reach the flag in each level.  Falling off the bottom of the
screen or squashing the slime results in dying.  Blue squares are checkpoints;
the last one you touched turns green.

    CONTROLS

arrow keys, WASD: move, jump.
space: jump.
escape, backspace: pause/unpause.
mouse movement: move the visible window.
R: reset the level.

WASD to move and R to reset are in the same position for the AZERTY (ZQSD R)
and Dvorak (,AOE P) keyboard layouts too.

To quit, close the window.
